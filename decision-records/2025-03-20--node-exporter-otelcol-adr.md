# Node-exporter inside or alongside otelcol charm

## Context and Problem Statement

The [Prometheus Node Exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/) binary exposes a wide variety of hardware and kernel-related metrics.

In the case of `grafana-agent`, it comes with an embedded version of `node-exporter` which is very practical since every time we deploy a `grafana-agent` charm, `node-exporter` is also running so we can collect metrics from the host in which they are running.

On the other hand OpenTelemetry Collector has a [Host Metrics Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver/README.md) which can be enabled in the configuration. But this receiver does not exposes the same metrics `node-exporter` exposes, so all the charms relying on these metrics to generate dashboards and alert rules would have to be modifierd.

Since there is no `node-exporter` embedded in `otelcol` so we need to come up with a solution in order to keep the feature parity with `grafana-agent`.

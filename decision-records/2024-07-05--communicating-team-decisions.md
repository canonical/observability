## Context and Problem Statement

We sometimes are contacted by other teams or customers to address some issue or feature request; that can lead to some commitments that may or may not be captured in Jira/GitHub issues.
One example could be "committing to support *something* until *some point in time*".

These types of commitment should be captured either in an ADR (if public), or in *observability-docs* (if private).

# Dashboard collisions in Grafana

## Context and Problem Statement
Grafana [documented](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/#reusable-dashboard-urls) that dashboards should not have the same *title* within a folder, or the same *uid* within installations.

This causes some problems in different scenarios.

### Problem 1: Two charms on different revisions

`charm(rev1, dashboard v1) <--> grafana <--> charm(rev2, dashboard v2)`

Unless manually modified, `dashboard v1` and `dashboard v2` have the same *title* and *uid*, which will cause problems in Grafana.

### Problem 2: Collision in UID or Title for different charms

`loki(dashboard "Overview") <--> grafana <--> tempo(dashboard "Overview")`

If both charms have a dashboard simply named "Overview", we have problems. Suggesting a UID and Title to be manually upgraded on every dashboard modification (to avoid (1)) seems like a tedious UX.

## Decision

We have chosen the solution ???.

## Solutions Considered

### Solution 1: On collision, keep latest dashboard revision

If we received a "newer dashboard" from a higher revision of a charm, we'd only keep the latest dashboard.

**Advantages**: Solves (1), shouldn't be hard to implement.
**Disadvantages**: Doesn't solve (2).

### Solution 2: Generate UID and inject charm revision in the title

The *uid* can be generated by something (like the dashboard JSON) and changed on-the-fly, and we could inject the charm revision and/or name in the *title* (is there a size limit?).

**Advantages**: Solves(1) and (2).
**Disadvantages**: potentially more implementation work.

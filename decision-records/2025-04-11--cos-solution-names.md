## Context and Problem Statement
The Observability team offers a few COS solutions.  These need clear and consistent names.

## Decision

COS products will be referred to by the following:

* `COS Lite`: Refers to the original Canonical Observability Stack product (without HA)
  * Note, the product is not `COS-lite`, `cos-lite` or `COS Light`
* `COS`: Refers to the Canonical Observability Stack that includes HA (eg: mimir instead of prometheus)

## Context and Problem Statement
When an admin forms a tls relation, there is a time window in which:

1. the juju model tells us we must operate with TLS enabled (the desired/planned state); however
2. we haven't received the server cert yet (actual, transient state).

As a result we had some code ordering issues (e.g. #414):
- Should we update the config file with the tls config, which includes path to
  the cert, before we got the cert, only to perfectly reflect the juju model?
  (Loki will fail to start this way.)
- Should we wait with the tls config and allow the workload to continue to
  operate in plain http, in contradiction to the juju model? (Cert may take a
  long time to arrive, so we may be compromising sensitive data.)
- How should we determine within the charm if "TLS is enabled"?

This problem is common to many charms.

## Decision
A server shall NOT keep using plain http while waiting for a cert. The service
must be stopped until the cert is in place (in the workload container(s), and
often in the charm container as well) and the tls config is updated.
The charm shall have a "Waiting" status during that period (subject to other
status priorities).

We also distinguish between several substates:
- TLS disabled: a tls-certificate is not in place, no certs on disk, no tls
  section in app config, app is running in plain HTTP mode.
- TLS enabled: a tls-certificate relation is present.
- Cert ready: we have a cert in relation data.
- TLS config ready: the cert that is in relation data was written to disk, and
  app config has a corresponding tls section.
- TLS active: the app is running with the new config.

    [*] --> TLSDisabled : install

    TLSDisabled: TLS disabled
    note right of TLSDisabled
        No TLS relation
        No certs on disk
        No TLS section in app config
        App running in plain HTTP mode
    end note
    TLSDisabled --> TLSEnabled : tls-relation-joined

    OUT: Service outage
    state OUT {
        TLSEnabled: TLS enabled
        note left of TLSEnabled
            TLS relation present
            CSR sent, waiting for cert, or cert expired or revoked
        end note
        TLSEnabled --> CertReady: tls-relation-changed
        CertReady: Cert ready
        note left of CertReady
            A live cert is in relation data
        end note
        CertReady --> TLSReady
        TLSReady: TLS config ready
        note right of TLSReady
            The cert that is in relation data was written to disk
            App config has a corresponding tls section
        end note
        TLSReady --> TLSActive
    }

    TLSActive: TLS active
    note right of TLSActive
        App restarted and operates in TLS
    end note
    TLSActive --> TLSActive : cert update

    TLSActive --> TLSEnabled : cert revoked, cert expired
```

## Benefits
- No need to worry if it takes the cert a long time to arrive.
- We stick to the juju model: if admin says HTTPS, then no
  more plain HTTP.

## Disadvantages
- We may incur data loss if the cert takes so long to arrive that clients begin
  to drop data due to back-pressure.

## Alternatives considered
- Keep operating in plain http until we receive the cert.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    PlainHTTP: Workload operates in plain HTTP
    state PlainHTTP {
        [*] --> NoTLS : install
        NoTLS: No TLS relation, no certs on disk

        Waiting: CSR sent, waiting for cert
        NoTLS --> Waiting : tls-relation-joined
    }

    TLSEnabled: Cert written, app restarted, TLS enabled
    Waiting --> TLSEnabled : tls-relation-changed

    TLSEnabled --> TLSEnabled : cert update

    TLSEnabled --> NoTLS : cert revoked (e.g. relation-removed)
```

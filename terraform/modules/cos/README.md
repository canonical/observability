Terraform module for COS HA solution

This is a Terraform module facilitating the deployment of COS HA solution, using the [Terraform juju provider](https://github.com/juju/terraform-provider-juju/). For more information, refer to the provider [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/juju/juju/latest/docs). 

The HA solution consists of the following Terraform modules:
- [grafana-k8s](https://github.com/canonical/grafana-k8s-operator): Visualization, monitoring,and dashboards.
- [mimir](https://github.com/canonical/observability/tree/cos-ha/terraform/modules/mimir): Storage, metrics, and scalability.
- [s3-integrator](https://github.com/canonical/s3-integrator): facade for S3 storage configurations.
- [self-signed-certificates](https://github.com/canonical/self-signed-certificates-operator): certificates operator to secure traffic with TLS.

This Terraform module deploys COS with Mimir and Loki in their microservices modes, and grafana, prometheus, and loki in monolithic mode.

> [!NOTE]  
> `s3-integrator` itself doesn't act as an S3 object storage system. For the HA solution to be functional, `s3-integrator` needs to point to an S3-like storage. See [this guide](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/cos-lite-docs-set-up-minio/15211) to learn how to connect to an S3-like storage for traces.

## Requirements
This module requires a `juju` model to be available. Refer to the [usage section](#usage) below for more details.

## API

### Inputs
The module offers the following configurable inputs:

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| - | - | - | - |
| `channel`| string | Channel that the charms are deployed from | latest/edge |
| `model_name`| string | Name of the model that the charm is deployed on |  |

### Outputs
Upon application, the module exports the following outputs:

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `app_name`|  Application name |
| `provides`| Map of `provides` endpoints |
| `requires`|  Map of `requires` endpoints |

## Usage


### Basic usage

Users should ensure that Terraform is aware of the `juju_model` dependency of the charm module.

To deploy this module with its needed dependency, you can run `terraform apply -var="model_name=<MODEL_NAME>" -auto-approve`. This would deploy all COS HA solution modules in the same model.

### High Availability 

By default, this Terraform module will deploy each worker with `1` unit. To configure the module to run `x` units of any worker role, you can run `terraform apply -var="model_name=<MODEL_NAME>" -var="<ROLE>_units=<x>" -auto-approve`.
See each ... for the recommended scale for each role.
